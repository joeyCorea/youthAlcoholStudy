    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "* During the data preparation and data understanding phases, it became apparent that the dataset might be too small to build an effective model.\n",
    "* Modelling continued to establish learning curves to see if emergent relationships could increase investor buy-in to recruit more participants.\n",

    "# Project Structure\n",
    "The output of the project is split between the following notebooks:\n",
    "* Introduction and business understanding (what you're currently reading).\n",
    "* Data Preparation, Understanding and Exploration.\n",
    "* Modelling Student Alcohol Consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "The aim of this data mining project is to:\n",
    "* investigate the Student Alcohol Consumption dataset for suitability to investigate the questions below.\n",
    "* to build and evaluate prediction models that:\n",
    "    * predict student alcohol consumption (specifically, problematic consumption).\n",
    "    * predict student academic achievement.\n",
    "    * predict overall student health.\n",
    "* to aid in this prediction, the dataset provides data on the student themselves, as well as their school, academic record, home situation, extracurricular activities and alcohol consumption.\n"
